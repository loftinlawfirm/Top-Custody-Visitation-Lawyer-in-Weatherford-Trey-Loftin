Key Terms in Texas Custody Law

“Managing Conservatorship” = legal word for custody

“Possession and Access” = legal term for visitation

Physical custody refers to where the child lives or spends time

Legal custody involves major decisions such as education, medical care, religious upbringing, and activities
